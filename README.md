# Childrenâ€™s Hospital Personal Health Dashboard
This is my capstone project that collaborated with two other students in the program, Himmie Lau and Devansh Saxena. Our goal was to develop an interactive health dashboard for the Pediatric Cardiology Dyslipidemia Clinic, aiming at enhancing patient and parent engagement in health management. I contributed majorly to data analysis and data visualization, including developing data pipelines to clean raw de-identified patient data using Python, building the scoring system, and visualizing data using Tableau.
